# AI-Enabled Water Well Predictor

## Overview
This web-based system leverages the National Aquifer Mapping and Management Programme (NAQUIM) data of the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), including lithology, geophysical logs, water levels, water quality, and aquifer maps, to aid users in making informed decisions about water well construction in specific locations.

## Features
- **Suitability Analysis**: Determines if an area is suitable for constructing a water well.
- **Depth Prediction**: Estimates the depth at which water-bearing zones are likely to be encountered.
- **Discharge Estimation**: Predicts the expected discharge of the well.
- **Drilling Technique Recommendation**: Suggests the most suitable drilling technique for the area.
- **Water Quality Forecast**: Provides a forecast of the expected groundwater quality.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Offers an intuitive graphical user interface for ease of use.
- **Feedback Collection**: Includes a system to collect user feedback in a structured manner.

## How to Use
1. Select a point on the map within the user interface.
2. The system will analyze the data and provide insights on the feasibility and specifics of constructing a water well in that location.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interpret the results and make decisions.
